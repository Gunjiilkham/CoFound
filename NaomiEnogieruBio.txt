My name is Naomi Enogieru. I am a 3rd year computer science major at Drexel University. 
I also have concentrations in machine learning and software engineering. On previous projects and internships, 
I have worked with languages such as Python, Djaango (which is a web development framework), and C#. I am mostly interested in back-end development positions, which is why I took on the role as a back-end developer for our group's project. 
I also work best in a collaborative and teamwork environment, as efficient problem solving leads to successful project outcomes.
